#In Season - Web Client

*This app is still under development.*

What's in season today?  Eating "in season" produce is a widely adopted nutrition concept and promotes several health benefits.  Nobody wants to remember the different lists as the seasons and months pass, but we all want to know what they are at varying random times of the day.  This app will push notifications to users that are interested in fruits and vegetables that are in season based on the user's preferences and location.

**Let's make eating well *easy*.**

## How it works
This is the client-side web application that will allow the user to log in, view their favorite list of fruits and vegetables, allow for searching, adding, and removing their favorites.  The user will be able to select their notification method and frequency.
